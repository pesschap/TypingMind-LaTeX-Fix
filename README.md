# TypingMind-LaTeX-Fix

**This is 100% AI slop. I will try but am likely unable to help you with any problems you face in using this extension.**

If you use TypingMind for anything maths related, you will come to realise that the built-in LaTeX rendering works inconsistently.

For example:

-   $...$ is not recognised as inline LaTeX (There is a good reason for this, which is that $ symbols are used very frequently. Nonetheless I would still prefer things within $...$ to be recognised as inline LaTeX).
-   \(...\) for inline, \[...\] for display works sometimes but not always. I have been unable to recreate the circumstances of which they work. - (1)
-   (1) applies for
    \(
    ...
    \),
    \[
    ...
    \] as well - (2)

This extension attempts to solve all of these problems. **It is fully functional except (1) and (2) which I had difficulty in implementing.** I welcome anyone willing to help.

To get this to work, simply add the following link into your TypingMind extensions:

**I am cognisant that I may have been mistakenly referencing 'LaTeX' wrongly.**
